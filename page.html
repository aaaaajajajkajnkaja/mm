        <p><center>"The author argues that monarchies allow for a stable head of state that is not influenced by money, media, or political affiliation, and that by uniting countries under one leader, monarchs can prevent civil wars. For example, the Habsburg dynasty in Europe united the region, and without it, regions quickly split apart into separate countries. He also argues that monarchies prevent extreme forms of government by making it fixed. He says that monarchies are better at making hard decisions fast, giving the example of Hirihoto defying his militaryâ€™s wish and opting for surrender, which saved many lives. He further argues that monarchies increase nationalism and allow for greater equality regardless of personality."</center></p>
